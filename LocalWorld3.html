        <h2>Megalodon: The Ancient Giant Shark</h2>
        <p>Common Name: Megalodon</p>
        <p>Scientific Name: Carcharocles megalodon</p>
        <p>Type: Prehistoric</p>
        <p>Megalodon was an enormous shark, believed to have reached lengths of up to 60 feet (18 meters) or more. Its size dwarfed that of modern great white sharks, making it the largest known shark species in history. Megalodon had a robust body, a powerful tail, and a large, wide head filled with rows of sharp, serrated teeth. Its teeth alone could reach over 7 inches (18 centimeters) in length, enabling it to prey upon large marine mammals.
          Habitat:
          Megalodon inhabited oceans across the globe, preferring warm and temperate waters. Fossil records indicate that it lived during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs, approximately 23 to 2.6 million years ago. These sharks were highly adaptable and could navigate various marine environments, from coastal regions to deep open waters.
          Diet:
          As a top predator, Megalodon had a voracious appetite and fed on a diverse range of prey. Its diet primarily consisted of marine mammals such as whales, seals, and dolphins. Megalodon's immense size and powerful bite allowed it to capture and consume these large marine mammals with relative ease.
          Average Life Span:
          The exact average life span of Megalodon is uncertain due to its extinction millions of years ago. However, based on growth rates estimated from fossilized teeth, it is believed that Megalodon had a relatively long life span, possibly reaching up to 30 years or more.
          Size and Weight:
          Megalodon was an immense creature, and estimates suggest that it could have weighed up to 60 to 70 tons (54,000 to 63,500 kilograms). Its size and weight far surpassed that of any living shark species, making it an apex predator of its time.</p>
